                                Good salary for an intern. We were also given rigorous training for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate and they paid for the exam too; but after that; there wasn't much to do. The internship program could improve more; but I would say that it's still better than most internships out there because I could assure you that they value and take care of all of their employees. Great experience if you want to pursue a career in Cloud Computing or DevOps.

                                Mostly just chilled and did chika-chika in the office with the other workers, never ever had to touch a computer, and just did basic things like answer calls and extend telephone lines. I was told you get to do more if you were interning at the main DPWH office.

                                Gained practical experience here with a lot of projects that you’re assigned to/can initiate yourself as an intern. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in the startup space in the PH. Though the commute to the office is inconvenient

                                They give minimal payment, and is given only after your internship. Took a while before I received my pay. They do give you free products from the brand/s you handle. Tasks vary from day to day. You do more of the physical labor, rather than really develop your skills. Honestly don’t think it’s a great place to really learn about the department/type of work you want to explore. I think experience would depend on the brand you handle as well :)
